# SSH configuration
#
# the fence agent requires SSH access to the quorum nodes in order to recover
# from a node restart. This access must provide root level access on the remote
# node in order to access resources that are not accessible without it.
#

## SSH=/bin/ssh
## SSH_USER=root

# It is generally a good idea to put the private key in a non-default location
# so that it can't inadvertently be used for casual remote SSH access from one
# node to another. This should point to the full path of the `id_rsa` file (without
# `.pub`). Add the contents of the `id_rsa.pub` file to the remote machines and
# into the contents of the `$SSH_USER/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. For clusters with
# 3 or more nodes, there should be multiple entries.

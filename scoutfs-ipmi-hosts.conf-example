# Example scoutfs-ipmi-hosts.conf file
#
# Install this file to `/etc/scoutfs/` and edit as needed. As a general
# rule of thumb: all nodes should be listed, and this file should look
# exactly the same on all scoutfs quorum nodes.
#

# ipmitool example:
#
# Format:
# <quorum IP>  <"ipmitool">  <ipmi server[:port]>
#
# ALl 3 fields are required. The port number to the ipmi/BMC
# may be omitted, the default port number is 624. If the BMC
# is on a different subnet than the quorum IPs, it may be different
# as is shown in the example below
## 10.0.2.130     ipmitool     10.0.1.130
## 10.0.2.131     ipmitool     10.0.1.131:624
## 10.0.2.132     ipmitool     10.0.1.132:625


# powerman example:
#
# Format:
# <quorum IP>  <"powerman">   <pm_server[,pm_server...]:nodename>
#
# All 3 fields are required. Multiple powerman servers ("pm_server")
# may be listed and comma separated, all will be tried when needed. They
# can be either IP or hostname.
## 10.0.2.130     powerman     pmserv1,10.0.1.55:scfs-1
## 10.0.2.131     powerman     pmserv1,10.0.1.55:scfs-2
## 10.0.2.132     powerman     pmserv1,10.0.1.55:scfs-3


# vsphere example:
#
# Format:
# <quorum IP>  <"vsphere">  <vs_server:nodename>
#
# All 3 fields are required. The vsphere server name may be an IP
# address. The field after the colon (:) is the domain name or 
# node name.
## 10.0.2.200   vsphere   vsphere-admin:vm50001
## 10.0.2.201   vsphere   vsphere-admin:vm50002
## 10.0.2.202   vsphere   vsphere-admin:vm50003
